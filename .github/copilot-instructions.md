# Copilot Project Instructions

## GitHub Actions & Automation
- Workflow configuration lives under `.github/workflows/`. Any additions should document new environment variables in the README.

## Documentation Expectations
- Update `README.md` and `CHANGELOG.md` alongside feature work. Follow the Keep a Changelog format for version entries and include release links.
- Provide examples or configuration snippets when introducing new CLI flags or workflow options.

Following these instructions keeps automated formatting, documentation, and CI behavior consistent across the project.
